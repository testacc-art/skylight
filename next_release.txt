1,  Use a unified icon pakage for all the icons
2,  Agree on a common style for each type of widgets used.
      - Styles include graphical and regular widget properties like color, sizes, size_hints, etc.
      - This also applies to layouts. For example, spacing between widgets in a boxlayout or gridlayout, padding, etc.
3,  Replace the default settings panel.
4,  Extend the dataview widget so that it can be selectable and more easy to interact with.
5,  Add drag and drop fuctionality for excel files in the sms/forms/result_update.py module
6,  Handle passports (Probably a backend problem)
7,  Add color effects to some selected widgets like the buttons.
      - For example, an hover of the cursor over a button would animate a color progression across it.
      - The kivy.uix.effectwidget.EffectWidget class would mostly likely be able to introduce such functionality.
8,  Include an easter egg.
9,  A way to copy password to clipboard after auto-generation
10, Add zoom and pan functionality to reports view
